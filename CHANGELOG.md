## 0.3.0 
- [Customizing naming services](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift#customizing-naming-services)
Version 0.3.0 introduced the `Configurations` struct that is used for configuring each connected naming service.
Library can offer three naming services at the moment:

* `cns` resolves `.crypto` domains,
* `ens` resolves `.eth` domains,
* `zns` resolves `.zil` domains

*By default, each of them is using the mainnet network via infura provider. 
Unstoppable domains are using the infura key with no restriction for CNS.
Unstoppable domains recommends setting up your own provider for ENS, as we don't guarantee ENS Infura key availability. 
You can update each naming service separately*
