# Resolution-swift CHANGELOG

## 2.0.1
- Fix `Resolution#tokensOwnedBy` issue with lowercased addresses.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- `Resolution#isSupported` is now making an async call. Method signature was changed.
- `Configurations` class accepts `uns` configs instead of  `cns`. 
  - For example: `let resolution = try Resolution(configs: Configurations(uns: NamingServiceConfig(...uns config)));`

### New methods and features

- Support new TLD's ( .888, .nft, .coin, .blockchain, .wallet, .x, .bitcoin, .dao ) 
- Introduce Resolution#tokenURI - Retrieves the tokenURI from the registry smart contract
- Introduce Resolution#tokenURIMetadata - Retrieves the data from the endpoint provided by tokenURI from the registry smart contract.
- Introduce Resolution#unhash - Retrieves the domain name from token metadata that is provided by tokenURI from the registry smart contract
- Return `ENS` support
- Allowed custom networks for each of the naming services. If custom network has been set, it is required to set the proxyReader contract address for UNS and registryAddress for ENS && ZNS (see `./Sources/UnstoppableDomainsResolution/Resources/UNS/uns-config.json`)

- Auto network ([#32](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift/pull/32)) via [@JohnnyJumper](https://github.com/JohnnyJumper)
- Move Base58 lib from dependencies to internal sources.

## 0.3.0 
- [Customizing naming services](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift#customizing-naming-services)
Version 0.3.0 introduced the `Configurations` struct that is used for configuring each connected naming service.
Library can offer three naming services at the moment:

* `cns` resolves `.crypto` domains,
* `ens` resolves `.eth` domains,
* `zns` resolves `.zil` domains

*By default, each of them is using the mainnet network via infura provider. 
Unstoppable domains are using the infura key with no restriction for CNS.
Unstoppable domains recommends setting up your own provider for ENS, as we don't guarantee ENS Infura key availability. 
You can update each naming service separately*
